# MatcherBot
MatcherBot is a simple physical computing game where the player has to match the word shown in the game by touching the objects connected to the computer through Makey Makey. It can also be played in a Raspberry Pi with Capacitive Touch Sensors which can convert conductive physical objects into keys. MatcherBot is for Educators and everyone who wants to make traditional selecting games more fun. The logic behind MatcherBot is that the words are mapped with a key. When the word is shown on the screen, the player gets a point when the right key is pressed and the player loses if the wrong key is pressed. While the game can be played just using a normal keyboard, it serves the best when played with physical object keys enabled through hardware like Makey Makey, etc.

To play in Matcherbot, first one has to generate a gamedata file. Two sample gamedata files are already given in the game_data folder to get started with the game. The gamedata file contains the word and the corresponding answer key. The new gamedata files can be generated in the manage game section which can be accessed by clicking the Matcherbot icon thrice in the Select game screen. The password to enter is 5555. Just a mechanism to prevent our cheeky students from mismanaging the game ;) .

To Run the game:
- Open startgame.html
- Select game from game_data folder
- Begin game
